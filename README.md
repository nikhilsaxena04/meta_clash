Meta Clash is a fast, theme-based card battle game. Type any universe — anime, manga, games — and instantly create a multiplayer lobby with cards, stats, bots, and real-time battles.

## 🚀 Features

* Create or join multiplayer lobbies (up to 4 players)
* Auto-fill bots if lobby isn’t full
* Generates 24 themed cards per game
* Card stats: Rank, Strength, Speed, IQ
* Turn-based attribute battles (Top-Trumps style)
* Smooth UI with animations
* Real-time gameplay via Socket.io

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a universe (e.g., *One Piece*).
2. Server generates 24 cards.
3. Cards are divided among players/bots.
4. Players join the same room via Socket.io.
5. Active player chooses a stat.
6. All cards are compared; winner gains points.
7. After 6 rounds, the highest score wins.
