## 🚀 Features

* Create or join multiplayer lobbies (up to 4 players)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a universe (e.g., *One Piece*).
2. Server generates 24 cards.
3. Cards are divided among players/bots.
4. Players join the same room via Socket.io.
5. Active player chooses a stat.
6. All cards are compared; winner gains points.
7. After 6 rounds, the highest score wins.
